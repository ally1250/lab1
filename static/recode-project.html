  <h1>ReCode CORE Platform Redesign Project</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) Platform is created and
    maintained by a UC San Diego organization called ReCode Health. ReCode
    Health aims to inform ethical health research practices so they built the
    CORE Platform to help health researchers connect and share expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The objective of the redesign is to develop a cleaner and more user-friendly
    interface to encourage more user interactions. My work mainly focuses on
    improving the organization of information and the functionality of the search filters.
  </p>
  <p>
    After getting the teamâ€™s approval of the redesign, I am in the process
    of implementing the new CORE Platform layout with React.js.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <b>
    ReCode Health wants to make the entire CORE Platform more user-friendly
    in terms of information search and display to allow users to quickly and 
    easily find the information they are searching for.
