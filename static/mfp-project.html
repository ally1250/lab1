  <h1>MyFitnessPal Fitness App Project</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we redesigned the MyFitnessPal app with the objective
    to encourage personal connections during the pandemic. MyFitnessPal is
    a nutrition intake and exercise tracker that helps users to maintain a
    balanced life style. It has a large and active community but is not getting noticed.
  </p>
  <p>
    IOur redesign reorganized the existing features in the MyFitnessPal community
    to emphasize the interactive and communicative aspects of MyFitnessPal.
    We integrated and features into a new panel called “Challenges” to encourage
    more engagement on various fitness topics. While providing a better experience
    with a more modern user interface, our main goal was to improve user loyalty
    and commitment by creating more interpersonal interactions between the users.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <b>
    New MyFitnessPal users who joined at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic
    to adapt to their dramatic lifestyle changes need mental support and
    guidance from a community to have a consistent fitness journey and healthy lifestyle.
