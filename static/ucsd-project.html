  <h1>UC San Diego Official App Project</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Basic Needs is an organization at UC San Diego that organizes campus events
    for distributing free food resources to students in need. Interested students
    can sign up for free food event notifications through the UC San Diego mobile app.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help Basic Needs facilitate event attendance tracking, we created an RSVP
    feature in the UC San Diego mobile app for students to conveniently register
    for free food events and check food availability.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task was to design and integrate the RSVP feature with the current free
    food notifications in the app.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <b>
    Basic Needs wants a way to keep track of the number of students attending the
    free food events in order to prepare food accordingly.
