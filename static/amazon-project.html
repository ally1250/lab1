  <h1>Amazon Internship Project</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    For my intern project at Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) team,
    I built an HTTP analyzer called the Har Viewer that visualizes network
    requests for production traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the scenario when a customer files a ticket complaining about a really
    long page load, it is almost impossible for developers to quickly identify
    the cause if not enough context about the client-side activity is provided.
    Therefore, the objective of my intern project at Amazon was to design and
    build a tool for developers to check client-side network traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the Har Viewer, developers can easily pinpoint any cause of slow
    performance by tracing API call details within a given time range.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <b>
    Developers need a convenient way to learn about client-side activity
    in order to identify and analyze performance issues.
